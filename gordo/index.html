 </header>
<h3>The Hunters and The Hunt</h3>
<p>The hunters are a group of warriors who are dedicated to keeping their regions safe by hunting down beasts - or anything other than beasts if need be - that pose a threat.
Hunters are agile fighters armed with a trick weapon, a transforming melee weapon in the right hand, and a firearm in the left.
They do not employ shields, but rather take advantage of their mobility in order to avoid attacks.
Hunters exist throughout the world and are not exclusive to Yharnam, since a number of characters such as the protagonist and Eileen come from the outside world and
are yet still recognized as hunters. However, it is believed that the Hunters started out as a branch of the Healing Church very much like The Choir.
 This would mean that, at least in Yharnam, Hunters were recruited by either <strong>Gehrman or the Church itself.</strong></p>

<h4>The City of Yharnam</h4>
<p>Yharnam is a towering, labyrinthine gothic city, home to both the Healing Church and the Blood Ministrations. 
As no evidence of the existence of a ruling body is provided in the game, one may presume that the Healing Church controls the city (at least indirectly). 
The Church focuses around healing by infusions of blood. Miraculously, blood healing can repair wounds and cure or hinder diseases.
Yharnam's whole culture became focused on blood, even to the point of blood-based drinks surpassing alcoholic beverages as the most commonly consumed.
Yharnam's populace is apparently viewed as insane or degenerate by the wider world, and the citizens have become extremely distrustful of non-natives as a result.</p>

<h5>The Red Moon</h5>
<p>The Red Moon is a nightmare revealed after slaying Rom, the Vacuous Spider
 who had placed a veil over the world to keep the secret of the true nature of the world from its residents.
  The servants of Amygdala become fully powered, the beasts become more ravenous, and <em>the children of Amygdala are visible at last.</em>
   In this nightmare, the world reveals the Eldritch abominations it has been truly hiding.
    As a result, everything gets worse, and the character sees the world as they would if they had amassed 40 insight.
     Unfortunately, by killing Rom, you usher in the Red Moon, which is believed by some to be the coming of Oedon.
      It is not clear that Oedon is the Moon Presence, but he very well could be.</p>

      My favorite umbilical cords (in no particular order)
      <ul> 
        <li>The one in the workshop</li>
        <li>The one on fake Iosefka</li>
        <li>The one you get for killing god or whatever</li></ul>

The Umbilical Cords
<p>While this presents a weird part of the story, it is a known fact that 75% of the game’s umbilical cords can be found on women or children.
During the Red Moon, Iosefka’s dialogue suggests that she has become pregnant, and Arianna gets pregnant as well.
You also find a cord from defeating Mergo’s Wet Nurse. This suggests that  Oedon impregnates women on the Red Moon.
The criteria of these women who are impregnated has not been determined. It also seems to be that the Great Ones impregnate women to have surrogate children.
It is worth noting that one of the four umbilical cords is in the abandoned Workshop, very near the doll. </p>
